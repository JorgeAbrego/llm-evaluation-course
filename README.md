## Lesson 5: Evals for classification tasks

We‚Äôll dive into evaluating real LLM applications. You‚Äôll learn how to solve different tasks with LLMs, build sample apps, and evaluate them.

We‚Äôll start with a text classification task and build a query classifier for a travel support chatbot.

### ‚úÖ Evaluating an LLM-based classifier
While classification is a relatively simple task, it is often a component of larger AI systems. For example, when building an AI agent, the first step might be classifying user intent to route queries to the best prompt or tool. These smaller components can be evaluated as a classification problem.

In this video, we will build a classifier for a travel support chatbot that sorts user queries into categories like ‚Äúbooking‚Äù or ‚Äútechnical issue.‚Äù We‚Äôll also solve this task with a simple ML classifier to use as a baseline, and compare its performance to an LLM-based one. Let‚Äôs get started!

## Lesson 10: Adversarial testing tutorial

Today, we‚Äôll talk about adversarial testing for LLM applications. We‚Äôll explore what adversarial testing is, why it matters, and how to use it to uncover vulnerabilities in your system.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Tutorial on adversarial testing for LLM apps
‚ÄãAdversarial testing is a technique for evaluating how AI systems respond to malicious or risky inputs. It is a crucial step in assessing the safety of user-facing and high-stakes applications, particularly in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare.
