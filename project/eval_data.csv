How are node embeddings updated in a simple Graph CNN layer?,"In a simple Graph CNN layer, node embeddings are updated by (i) aggregating the neighboring nodes to form a single vector, (ii) applying a linear transformation to the aggregated nodes, (iii) applying the same linear transformation to the original node, (iv) adding these together with a bias, and finally (v) applying a nonlinear activation function."
"What is an adjacency matrix in graph representation, and how is it defined?","The adjacency matrix is a binary matrix where element (m, n) is set to one if node m connects to node n."
What is the relationship between the least squares criterion and the fit of a linear model?,"The least squares criterion minimizes the sum of the squares of the deviations between the model prediction and the true output values. A good fit results in small deviations, while a bad fit results in large deviations. This criterion follows from the assumption that the model predicts the mean of a normal distribution over the outputs and that we maximize the probability."
What are the desiderata for network layers in normalizing flows?,"The desiderata for network layers in normalizing flows are: 1) the set of network layers must be sufficiently expressive to map a multivariate standard normal distribution to an arbitrary density, 2) the network layers must be invertible and define a unique one-to-one mapping from any input point to an output point, 3) it must be possible to compute the inverse of each layer efficiently, and 4) it must be possible to evaluate the determinant of the Jacobian efficiently for either the forward or inverse mapping."
What is the role of the diffusion kernel q(zt|x) in the diffusion encoder process?,"The diffusion kernel q(zt|x) plays a crucial role in the diffusion encoder process as it allows us to compute the marginal distribution q(zt) by superimposing the kernel on each sample from the data distribution Pr(x). This kernel ""skips"" the intervening variables, enabling us to write q(zt) as the integral of q(zt|x)Pr(x)dx."
Backpropagation method for neural nets?,"The backpropagation algorithm is an efficient method for computing the derivatives of the loss function with respect to the model parameters. It consists of a forward pass, in which we compute and store a series of intermediate values and the network output, and a backward pass, in which we compute the derivatives of the loss function with respect to the model parameters."
Loss functions for graph regression & binary classification?,"For graph-level tasks, the loss functions used are the least squares loss for regression and the binary cross-entropy loss for binary classification."
How can a 2-hidden-layer network be broken down into 2 shallow ones?,"A 2-hidden-layer network can be broken down into 2 shallow ones by considering the first network as producing an output that is a linear combination of the activations at the hidden units, and then the second network applies a function to this output. This can be seen as a special case of a deep network with two hidden layers, where the output of the first network is passed into the second network."
What is the role of a linear transformation in a simple Graph CNN layer?,"In a simple Graph CNN layer, a linear transformation is applied to the aggregated neighboring nodes and to the original node, and the results are added together with a bias term before passing through a nonlinear activation function."
